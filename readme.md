#ShareX Gallery

A gallery to dispay uploaded screenshots from ShareX built using Laravel. 

The gallery will work for any tool which can upload files to a specific folder, ShareX being a popular choice. 

The tool provides a password to access the gallery (set in the .env file) and also allows you to delete a screenshot when you view it. 

The tool will also generate thumbnails and manage them should you delete the original file. This allows for a quick loading page.
